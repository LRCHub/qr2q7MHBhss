Faster we drive, the hair stays sound
The beating heart took me down

The backseat that we're in
Won't let us touch the ground
Please let me in
I'm loose in every inch

Heaven loves the driver
Get me to the coast
Spare that lucky child

Graze,
Speed,
Grass,
Open air
The girl with three names got me green
Tired marine
I want to be that clean
Silverado
Become Magic
Kissing me

The backseat gets too cold
With time that lies to me
Sucking on codeine
American mermaid dream

Heaven loves the driver
Get me to the coast
Spare me because I'm tired
Spare that lucky child

Faster we drive, the hair stays sound
The beating heart took me down

The backseat that we're in
Won't let us touch the ground
Please let me in
I'm loose in every inch

Heaven loves the driver
Get me to the coast
Spare me because I'm tired
Spare that lucky child
