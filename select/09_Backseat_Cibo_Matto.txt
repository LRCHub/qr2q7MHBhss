If I turn to the right at the corner
I may find love within a short block
If I turn to the left at the corner
I might find an affair in the long way
I might step on a stone and hurt myself
I might step on a stone and hurt myself

Which way should I go now?
Should I keep on going this way?
Tell me now
'Cause I can't be in the back seat of love anymore

When I turn to the right at the corner
I may see the rough road you've been down
When I turn to the left at the corner
I might see all the stones you have thrown

I might feel alone with a silence
Does the map that you have show my home?

Which way should I go now? Should I keep on going this way
Tell me now
Cause I can't be in the backseat of love

(Doo interlude)

If I turn to the right at the corner
I may find love within a short block
If I turn to the left at the corner
I may find an affair in the long way

I might step on a stone and hurt myself
I might step on a stone and hurt myself

Which way should I go now?
Should I keep on going this way?
Tell me now
'Cause I can't be in the backseat of love anymore
