I was high when the sun went down
Still high when it came up, too
Up all night in my head
Only thing on my mind was you
Where you at? Need you by my side
Come a little bit closer, oh
Thinking about those nights we'd get fucked up
In the back of the Chevy, me and you

Girl, meet me in the backseat
In the backseat
Meet you in the backseat of the Chevy
Stay up all night, you and me
Living in my sleep and you my dream
Meet me in the backseat
In the backseat
Meet you in the backseat of the Chevy
Stay up all night, you and me
Living in my sleep and you my dream

So meet me in the backseat when you're ready
Tying up my arms with your favorite Fendi
And I can't hear a word that they ever tell me
And I've been getting numb hoping you forget me
Baby, just forget me
I'm losing myself, I can't ever find sleep
And you my favorite nightmare, Jack and Sally
And you can have it all, but you don't like asking
No, you don't like nothing but I don't blame you
And would you still stay if my hundreds weren't blue?
And when we burn to dust I will stay with you
And when I break down, will you keep your cool?

Meet me in the backseat
Baby, meet me in the backseat
Run it up like a track meet
Baby, fuck me in the backseat

I was high when the sun went down
Still high when it came back out
I was laying on the cold, wet ground
Thinking bout when you were still around
I took the long way home
Just so I could pass your old house
I was thinking how it looks so cold
And wondering who lives there now
'Cause I remember when

We were riding in the Chevy
40 in the backseat, cigarettes and caffeine
Heart was getting heavy
I said I was dead weight
Baby, we could both drown
You said you were so down
Baby, are you ready? Come with me
I just wanna show you everything
'Cause we both know there's nothing here for us
Stay with me until we turn to dust

Girl, meet me in the backseat
In the backseat
Meet you in the backseat of the Chevy
Stay up all night, you and me
Living in my sleep and you my dream
Meet me in the backseat
In the backseat
Meet you in the backseat of the Chevy
Stay up all night, you and me
Living in my sleep and you my dream
